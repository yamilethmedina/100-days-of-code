# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 9, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Working on building Timestamp API project.

**Thoughts:** I went down the rabbit hole of adding Clementine, which probably wasn't necessary for this project after all; however, I gained some experience with it! setting up MongoDB was also a bit of a pain.(run `sudo mongod --dbpath=/data` to make sure it start before starting your node app) But I got the project done!

### Day 1: January 10, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Work on Kimball/Miami CUT Group Project

**Thoughts:** The typeform gem is very light on documentation, making it hard to figure out where exactly the `require` statement should go. I'm now able to access all of the content in the API through the IRB console, but am not sure how to show it on the PeopleController yet.

### Day 2: January 11, 2017


**Today's Progress**: First 7 steps of Learnyounode

**Thoughts:** It was good to give myself a refresher on the Node.js basics. The modular challenge was surprisingly difficult, but I got through it.

### Day 3: January 12, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Step 8 of Learnyounode

**Thoughts:** Cloud9 was having problems loading the suggested npm modules, so I had to do it the vanilla way. Wanted to get more done but ran out of time.

### Day 4: January 13, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Steps 8 and 9 of Learnyounode

**Thoughts:** Had to do the Juggling Async challenge without the suggested module because of Cloud 9's issues. I was having trouble with an `undefined` showing up before each line in the console, but it turns out I was using `urlArguments` as a condition in a for loop instead of `urlArguments.length`.

### Day 5: January 14, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Steps 12 and 13 of Learnyounode

**Thoughts:** I was tired after a long day but wanted to keep my streak going! At first, I installed the module requested in Lesson 12 by copying it from the `learnyounode` folder and continuing to do so for every single one of its dependencies, which was a pain (for some reason c9 still has problems with npm despite my not having any internet access problems). Turns out I didn't need the module mentioned in the hint, but what the heck. I kept Googling various type errors and ended up with an undefined string because I made a typo and wrote `.toString` instead of `.toString()`, which obviously did nothing. But yay, this part is complete!

### Day 6: January 15, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Big O Chapter of Cracking the Coding Interview (Up to first 5 additional questions)

**Thoughts:** I was unable to get to my computer for most of the day, but I brought my book with me to study algorithms. We covered them a bit in my CS50 course, but recent experience has known that I clearly need a refresher! It was a bit of a struggle, especially since with the particular web projects I work on, algorithms aren't really front of mind. However, this chapter is definitely helping me focus on the difference between `O(log n)` (typically found with binary search-like algorithms, for example), `O(n)` (when a loop within the function iterates `n` number of times) and `O(1)` (constant time). I want to be able to solve them myself without looking back in the chapter for previous similar examples, but that will probably take more experience and time.

### Day 7: January 16, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Expressworks 

**Thoughts:** While i've worked somewhat extensively with Express before, I was using a lot of boilerplate and largely going through the motions on the actual server building. This helped me dig into Express and the middleware more deeply!

### Day 8: January 17, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Git-It

**Thoughts:** I needed to do a quick refresher on pull requests and merges because I haven't done a lot of team projects/work in awhile. This was perfect!

### Day 9: January 19, 2017


**Today's Progress**: First 6 steps of Learnyoumongo

**Thoughts:** I worked a lot and was sick, so by the time I got home I was really tired. I did continue reading Cracking the Coding Interview, but didn't have a lot of time to actually get to work. However, i'm back at it (tacking a day on to the end) and working on honing my MongoDB skills. I've worked with projects that use it, but haven't done as much with it myself as I have with SQL-based relational databases. I know the MEAN stack is really important, so this is valuable. I had to use some `chown` commands to make sure I didn't have to run it in `sudo` mode all the time, and there was a funny bit where nothing I seemed to do was working, and the error was occurring because I was editing a file in the wrong folder. Good times :)

### Day 10: January 20, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Finished Learnyoumongo
**Thoughts:** I was busy bogged down with work and training, but I still made it a point to get my time in! MongoDB was actually easier to work with today, although I had trouble with the final Aggregate challenge, because I didn't know how to force it to show the required number of decimal places. I had to look up the official solution, which still doesn't make sense to me (where does `var o = results[0]` come from?), but here I am.

### Day 11: January 22, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Work on Kimball/Miami CUT Group Project

**Thoughts:** I made some progress printing out the array of data in the console, but am having trouble iterating over it in the view because the `id` field is actually in a separate part of the API's output. I'm considering moving on to another part of the project and focusing more on the endpoints instead of the import.

### Day 12: January 23, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Code For Miami

**Thoughts:** Getting used to my part-time job was exhausting, but I made it a point to get to the weekly civic hack night. We focused on streamlining project selection for new members and marking which projects are inactive and which are actively looking for contributors.

### Day 13: January 24, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Request Header Parser Project

**Thoughts:** It was actually pretty easy for the most part! I just had to remember to `split` the language and software outputs I recieved from the browser, and it turns out that the `os` module doesn't quite do what I needed (for example, it gives `Darwin` instead of `Macintosh`), so I needed to go into the header's user agent to find that. There was also an issue with Heroku not being able to verify the language with a buildpack, but I got through it easily. Vital tip: your application may work even if you don't formally run `npm init`, but it's essential for deployment! (What can I say, it was late.) Also, upon further review, it seems like `req.headers['x-forwarded-for']` may be a better choice than `req.ip`, because the latter adds some random characters (a bunch of `f`s) before the IP address.

### Day 14: January 25, 2017
**Today's Progress**: URL Shortener Microservice Project

**Thoughts:** It was working until I started trying to save dummy data into MongoDB, and then localhost suddenly stopped responding. It was showing the URL on the browser and then suddenly it stopped, even when I commented out my latest additions to the code and went back to when it definitely worked. Might take a reboot to fix...

### Day 15: January 26, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Organizing Code for Miami projects

**Thoughts:** Still code-adjacent so I count it; going through all of the projects on the Code for Miami GitHub organization and checking to see which repos are active, which are live but unmaintained, which are under construction, and which are inactive. This will make it far easier for everyone to decide what to work on in the future!

### Day 16: January 27, 2017
**Today's Progress**: URL Shortener Microservice Project

**Thoughts:** Turns out it was a minor syntax error - ESHint is a big help with that! However, now it's not retrieving saved URLs and shortcodes that I know for a fact are in the database -- why is `doc` (as in `function (err, doc) { if (doc != null) { res.redirect(doc.url);` appearing as null? :thinking: 
*Update:* It works on my localhost now! Remember to make sure that the `/:route` and `params` are the same name!

### Day 18: January 30, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Work on Kimball/Miami CUT Group Project

**Thoughts:** I'm back on track with a new plan to create route for a Typeform webhook to receive JSON POST requests and add new users to the application's database.

### Day 19: January 31, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Work on Kimball/Miami CUT Group Project

**Thoughts:** My webhook endpoint is giving the desired 200 status update when testing. Still figuring out how to deal with the 401 unauthorized error when trying to save to the database, since the application is password protected. I need to think about this most recent error log:

```{
  "token": "eebab08fff87e3c95487c7c17fdb9385",
  "status": 404,
  "body": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>The page you were looking for doesn't exist (404)</title>\n  <style>\n    body { background-color: #fff; color: #666; text-align: center; font-family: arial, sans-serif; }\n    div.dialog {\n      width: 25em;\n      padding: 0 4em;\n      margin: 4em auto 0 auto;\n      border: 1px solid #ccc;\n      border-right-color: #999;\n      border-bottom-color: #999;\n    }\n    h1 { font-size: 100%; color: #f00; line-height: 1.5em; }\n  </style>\n</head>\n\n<body>\n  <!-- This file lives in public/404.html -->\n  <div class=\"dialog\">\n    <h1>The page you were looking for doesn't exist.</h1>\n    <p>You may have mistyped the address or the page may have moved.</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>If you are the application owner check the logs for more information.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

### Day 20: February 2, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Work on Kimball/Miami CUT Group Project

**Thoughts:** The 401 error on the webhook is solved, thanks to a Stack Overflow Q. :smile: I ended up getting a 500 `NameError (uninitialized constant WebhooksController::Webhook):` on line 12 of my controller because a Webhook model didn't exist (a friend helped me figure out that error). Although I just added an (empty) webhook model and i'm still getting the same error...
