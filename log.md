**Today's Progress**: Working on building Timestamp API project.

**Thoughts:** I went down the rabbit hole of adding Clementine, which probably wasn't necessary for this project after all; however, I gained some experience with it! setting up MongoDB was also a bit of a pain.(run `sudo mongod --dbpath=/data` to make sure it start before starting your node app) But I got the project done!
