# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 9, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Working on building Timestamp API project.

**Thoughts:** I went down the rabbit hole of adding Clementine, which probably wasn't necessary for this project after all; however, I gained some experience with it! setting up MongoDB was also a bit of a pain.(run `sudo mongod --dbpath=/data` to make sure it start before starting your node app) But I got the project done!

### Day 1: January 10, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Work on Kimball/Miami CUT Group Project

**Thoughts:** The typeform gem is very light on documentation, making it hard to figure out where exactly the `require` statement should go. I'm now able to access all of the content in the API through the IRB console, but am not sure how to show it on the PeopleController yet.

### Day 2: January 11, 2017


**Today's Progress**: First 7 steps of Learnyounode

**Thoughts:** It was good to give myself a refresher on the Node.js basics. The modular challenge was surprisingly difficult, but I got through it.

### Day 3: January 12, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Step 8 of Learnyounode

**Thoughts:** Cloud9 was having problems loading the suggested npm modules, so I had to do it the vanilla way. Wanted to get more done but ran out of time.

### Day 4: January 13, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Steps 8 and 9 of Learnyounode

**Thoughts:** Had to do the Juggling Async challenge without the suggested module because of Cloud 9's issues. I was having trouble with an `undefined` showing up before each line in the console, but it turns out I was using `urlArguments` as a condition in a for loop instead of `urlArguments.length`.

### Day 5: January 14, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Steps 12 and 13 of Learnyounode

**Thoughts:** I was tired after a long day but wanted to keep my streak going! At first, I installed the module requested in Lesson 12 by copying it from the `learnyounode` folder and continuing to do so for every single one of its dependencies, which was a pain (for some reason c9 still has problems with npm despite my not having any internet access problems). Turns out I didn't need the module mentioned in the hint, but what the heck. I kept Googling various type errors and ended up with an undefined string because I made a typo and wrote `.toString` instead of .toString()`, which obviously did nothing. But yay, this part is complete!

### Day 6: January 15, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Big O Chapter of Cracking the Coding Interview (Up to first 5 additional questions)

**Thoughts:** I was unable to get to my computer for most of the day, but I brought my book with me to study algorithms. We covered them a bit in my CS50 course, but recent experience has known that I clearly need a refresher! It was a bit of a struggle, especially since with the particular web projects I work on, algorithms aren't really front of mind. However, this chapter is definitely helping me focus on the difference between `O(log n)` (typically found with binary search-like algorithms, for example), `O(n)` (when a loop within the function iterates `n` number of times) and `O(1)` (constant time). I want to be able to solve them myself without looking back in the chapter for previous similar examples, but that will probably take more experience and time.

### Day 7: January 16, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Expressworks 

**Thoughts:** While i've worked somewhat extensively with Express before, I was using a lot of boilerplate and largely going through the motions on the actual server building. This helped me dig into Express and the middleware more deeply!

### Day 8: January 17, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Git-It

**Thoughts:** I needed to do a quick refresher on pull requests and merges because I haven't done a lot of team projects/work in awhile. This was perfect!

### Day 9: January 19, 2017


**Today's Progress**: First 6 steps of Learnyoumongo

**Thoughts:** I worked a lot and was sick, so by the time I got home I was really tired. I did continue reading Cracking the Coding Interview, but didn't have a lot of time to actually get to work. However, i'm back at it (tacking a day on to the end) and working on honing my MongoDB skills. I've worked with projects that use it, but haven't done as much with it myself as I have with SQL-based relational databases. I know the MEAN stack is really important, so this is valuable. I had to use some `chown` commands to make sure I didn't have to run it in `sudo` mode all the time, and there was a funny bit where nothing I seemed to do was working, and the error was occurring because I was editing a file in the wrong folder. Good times :)

### Day 10: January 20, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Finished Learnyoumongo
**Thoughts:** I was busy bogged down with work and training, but I still made it a point to get my time in! MongoDB was actually easier to work with today, although I had trouble with the final Aggregate challenge, because I didn't know how to force it to show the required number of decimal places. I had to look up the official solution, which still doesn't make sense to me (where does `var o = results[0]` come from?), but here I am.
