# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 9, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Working on building Timestamp API project.

**Thoughts:** I went down the rabbit hole of adding Clementine, which probably wasn't necessary for this project after all; however, I gained some experience with it! setting up MongoDB was also a bit of a pain.(run `sudo mongod --dbpath=/data` to make sure it start before starting your node app) But I got the project done!

### Day 1: January 10, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Work on Kimball/Miami CUT Group Project

**Thoughts:** The typeform gem is very light on documentation, making it hard to figure out where exactly the `require` statement should go. I'm now able to access all of the content in the API through the IRB console, but am not sure how to show it on the PeopleController yet.

### Day 2: January 11, 2017


**Today's Progress**: First 7 steps of Learnyounode

**Thoughts:** It was good to give myself a refresher on the Node.js basics. The modular challenge was surprisingly difficult, but I got through it.

### Day 3: January 12, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Step 8 of Learnyounode

**Thoughts:** Cloud9 was having problems loading the suggested npm modules, so I had to do it the vanilla way. Wanted to get more done but ran out of time.

### Day 4: January 13, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Steps 8 and 9 of Learnyounode

**Thoughts:** Had to do the Juggling Async challenge without the suggested module because of Cloud 9's issues. I was having trouble with an `undefined` showing up before each line in the console, but it turns out I was using `urlArguments` as a condition in a for loop instead of `urlArguments.length`.
